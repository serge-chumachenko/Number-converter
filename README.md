# Number-converter

Function convert_n_to_m (x, n, m) takes three arguments:
1) integer number x (with base n) or string x which represents a number;
2) integer n (1 <= n);
3) integer m (m <= 36) ;
and returns a string which represents a number x in the scale of notation m.

If the argument x is not a number or a string, or may not be integral representation of a number with base n, logical constant return False.

Using this function, you can convert numbers from 1 to 36 of the scales of notation.
